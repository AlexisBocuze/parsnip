#' Technical aspects of the glmnet model
#'
#' `glmnet` is a package for penalized regression models that encompasses
#'  linear, logistic, Poisson, and multinomial regression models (as well as the
#'  Cox proportional hazards model for censored data). It is a very popular model
#'  and there are some nuances related to how it works that are important to
#'  discuss. This discussion will focus on linear regression but the points
#'  generalize to the other model types.
